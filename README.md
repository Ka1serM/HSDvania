A Project from the Hochschule Düsseldorf made in the winter semester 24/25

## The Plot
When an unassuming Student dozed off instead of paying attention during the lecture, they are trapped in a nightmare version of the school, complete with mad professors, dangerous cables and monitors to break.
The source of the protagonist' blight is their pending Bafög application, which is indeed a bureaucratic nightmare. Only if all Entries are collected can the applycation be sent and the spell keeping the procastinating student in this realm be lifted. But beware: go gameover and one has to do it all over again...
